        "question": "AITA for telling students they could leave | This was a while ago, but reading this sub got me wondering about it. \n\nA few years ago I was attending a community college. I also worked there, work-study, as a tutor. 2 days a week I sat in on the class I tutored for and helped students. \n\nI want to emphasize here that I was not a teachers assistant. I was told, explicitly, that I was just there to answer student questions during their free-work time, since it was a large class. \n\nOne day I got to the class and the teacher wasn't there. Students come, we all sit and wait... and wait... 35 minutes later (it was a 2 hour class) the teacher still wasn't there. I let the students go and go home myself. About an hour after that I got an email from the teacher, telling me how disappointed he is with me, how irresponsible it was to not keep the class there, and that he had been working with another student in his office and lost track of time, why didn't I come get him?\n\nThe next day I met with him to apologize and explain that I had, in fact, looked for him but I didn't know where his office was and the main office was closed because of the time. He basically said whatever, don't let it happen again and we moved on. \n\nSo I kinda feel like it's not my job to hunt down the teacher for his class, and I already kept the students longer than strictly necessary. Was I the asshole, though? It's true I didn't search hard for his office, by then I was kind of annoyed at wasting an afternoon when I had work of my own to do.",

The OP (original poster) was explicitly told they were only there to answer student questions during free-work time, not to act as a teacher's assistant. When the teacher didn't show up and kept the students waiting for 35 minutes, it wasn't unreasonable for the OP to let them leave after an hour of waiting. Additionally, they had their own work commitments to attend to. The OP did apologize and explain their actions to the teacher, which shows a willingness to",

        "question": "AITA for treating my stepfamily like extended family at my wedding? | My parents got divorced awhile ago, and both got remarried when I was an adult. Both my stepparents have their own adult children. I like everyone and never had a problem getting along with them, but I never thought of my step relatives as being on the same level as my parents or siblings since I didn't grow up with them. I think of them as extended family, and that's how I treated them at my wedding.\n\nI didn't think I was doing anything bad, but I found out that my stepdad and his kids are upset that they weren't included in the wedding like immediately family. I didn't include my stepdad or stepmom's names on the invitation or ask them to walk down the aisle with me and my parents. I wasn't trying to be deliberately exclusionary, they're just not my parents, so I didn't include them in those traditions. I also didn't ask any of my step siblings to be in the bridal party or have any role in the ceremony because we aren't that close and I don't feel like I have a sibling relationship with any of them. \n\nI did include my stepfamily in photos, but not all of them. We took photos with different combos of people, including some with just my parents and just siblings. I included my stepfamily in photos that included extended family (aunts, uncles, and cousins) but not the parent and sibling photos. It never occurred to me to have my stepfamily in immediate family photos and I wouldn't have been comfortable including them in all the photos.\n\nAs far as I know, it's only my stepdad and his kids that are upset, not my stepmom and her kids. I don't really understand why they are upset at not being included at such a high level, since we aren't that close.

        "model_answer": "Yes, you are the asshole (AITA). While your intentions may have been genuine, your treatment of your stepfamily at your wedding was exclusionary and hurtful to some members of that family.
