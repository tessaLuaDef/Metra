        "question": "AITA for telling students they could leave | This was a while ago, but reading this sub got me wondering about it. \n\nA few years ago I was attending a community college. I also worked there, work-study, as a tutor. 2 days a week I sat in on the class I tutored for and helped students. \n\nI want to emphasize here that I was not a teachers assistant. I was told, explicitly, that I was just there to answer student questions during their free-work time, since it was a large class. \n\nOne day I got to the class and the teacher wasn't there. Students come, we all sit and wait... and wait... 35 minutes later (it was a 2 hour class) the teacher still wasn't there. I let the students go and go home myself. About an hour after that I got an email from the teacher, telling me how disappointed he is with me, how irresponsible it was to not keep the class there, and that he had been working with another student in his office and lost track of time, why didn't I come get him?\n\nThe next day I met with him to apologize and explain that I had, in fact, looked for him but I didn't know where his office was and the main office was closed because of the time. He basically said whatever, don't let it happen again and we moved on. \n\nSo I kinda feel like it's not my job to hunt down the teacher for his class, and I already kept the students longer than strictly necessary. Was I the asshole, though? It's true I didn't search hard for his office, by then I was kind of annoyed at wasting an afternoon when I had work of my own to do.",

We live in my gf moms house. we do all of our stuff we just forget to turn off the lights occasionally and wait to do the dishes until there is enough to put in the dishwasher. We do have some messyness problems when it comes to our rooms but other than that we feel we’re decent. Yet whenever she comes home from work she is angry we haven’t done anything right away and that everything isn’t clean and she puts it upon herself to clean up the dishes we don’t think that we’re doing anything wrong we just do it on a different time frame where it is more productive we feel like what should we do?",

        "question": "AITA for wanting to sleep in? | Some back story, I wake up at 430am every weekday go to work til 830am, come home to my wife and daughter still sleeping and wake them up to start their day and eat breakfast. I then go back to work at 930 until roughly 5/6pm every day. \nI come home, I help out around the house, clean, bathe the kid sometimes I cook. Then I play video games until 9pm followed by a movie with the wife until roughly 11pm.\n\nWeekends are a completely different story, I get woken up at 9 by my wife and I tell her every time that I’d like just one day to sleep in, not until 2pm, but like 10/1030am because I’m tired from waking up and working long hours.\nWe proceed to get into a pretty heated argument about how when I’m home she expects me to do just as much as she does (which is understandable) but she asked all her friends about me sleeping in and they all tell her to “wake my ass up” “what the fuck parent wants to sleep in?” Etc etc.\n\nSo am I the asshole for wanting to sleep in, once? Not every weekend and not until the afternoon, but just one day til 10/1030?",

        "question": "AITA for treating my stepfamily like extended family at my wedding? | My parents got divorced awhile ago, and both got remarried when I was an adult. Both my stepparents have their own adult children. I like everyone and never had a problem getting along with them, but I never thought of my step relatives as being on the same level as my parents or siblings since I didn't grow up with them. I think of them as extended family, and that's how I treated them at my wedding.\n\nI didn't think I was doing anything bad, but I found out that my stepdad and his kids are upset that they weren't included in the wedding like immediately family. I didn't include my stepdad or stepmom's names on the invitation or ask them to walk down the aisle with me and my parents. I wasn't trying to be deliberately exclusionary, they're just not my parents, so I didn't include them in those traditions. I also didn't ask any of my step siblings to be in the bridal party or have any role in the ceremony because we aren't that close and I don't feel like I have a sibling relationship with any of them. \n\nI did include my stepfamily in photos, but not all of them. We took photos with different combos of people, including some with just my parents and just siblings. I included my stepfamily in photos that included extended family (aunts, uncles, and cousins) but not the parent and sibling photos. It never occurred to me to have my stepfamily in immediate family photos and I wouldn't have been comfortable including them in all the photos.\n\nAs far as I know, it's only my stepdad and his kids that are upset, not my stepmom and her kids. I don't really understand why they are upset at not being included at such a high level, since we aren't that close. I would think it was weird if one of my step siblings asked me to be a bridesmaid, or if my mom walked one of them down the aisle. AITA?",
