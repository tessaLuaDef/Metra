    "question": "As of 2014, about what percentage of primary aged children in Sub-Saharan Africa were out-of-school?",
    "answer": "20%",
    "contexts": "As of 2014, Sub-Saharan Africa is home to a significant portion of the global out-of-school population. The region faces numerous challenges in ensuring access to education for all children, particularly those living in rural areas or disadvantaged communities. Factors such as poverty, conflict, and gender inequality play a role in keeping children out of school. According to data from UNESCO, approximately 37% of primary-school-age children in Sub-Saharan Africa were not enrolled in school during this time, reflecting the region's ongoing struggle with education accessibility and affordability. This figure underscores the urgent need for continued investment in education initiatives aimed at reducing this number and providing quality education to all children across the region."
