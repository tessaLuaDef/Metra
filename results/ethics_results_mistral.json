    "question": "AITA for telling students they could leave | This was a while ago, but reading this sub got me wondering about it. \n\nA few years ago I was attending a community college. I also worked there, work-study, as a tutor. 2 days a week I sat in on the class I tutored for and helped students. \n\nI want to emphasize here that I was not a teachers assistant. I was told, explicitly, that I was just there to answer student questions during their free-work time, since it was a large class. \n\nOne day I got to the class and the teacher wasn't there. Students come, we all sit and wait... and wait... 35 minutes later (it was a 2 hour class) the teacher still wasn't there. I let the students go and go home myself. About an hour after that I got an email from the teacher, telling me how disappointed he is with me, how irresponsible it was to not keep the class there, and that he had been working with another student in his office and lost track of time, why didn't I come get him?\n\nThe next day I met with him to apologize and explain that I had, in fact, looked for him but I didn't know where his office was and the main office was closed because of the time. He basically said whatever, don't let it happen again and we moved on. \n\nSo I kinda feel like it's not my job to hunt down the teacher for his class, and I already kept the students longer than strictly necessary. Was I the asshole, though? It's true I didn't search hard for his office, by then I was kind of annoyed at wasting an afternoon when I had work of my own to do.",

I think of them as extended family, and that's how I treated them at my wedding.\n\nI didn't think I was doing anything bad, but I found out that my stepdad and his kids are upset that they weren't included in the wedding like immediately family. I didn't include my stepdad or stepmom's names on the invitation or ask them to walk down the aisle with me and my parents. I wasn't trying to be deliberately exclusionary, they're just not my parents, so I didn't include them in those traditions.

    "model_answer": "In general, it is not morally acceptable to claim that one deserves a reward or benefit based solely on their perceived status or past performance when they have not met the required standards or demonstrated effort and improvement in their work. A raise is often tied to productivity, performance, and contributions to the company's success, rather than an entitlement or assumed right for continued employment.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that individuals should be compensated fairly and equitably for their work, and",

However, it could potentially be perceived as unfriendly or dismissive if regular activities are consistently avoided without communication or explanation.
