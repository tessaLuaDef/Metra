He translated the Bible into German, which promoted literacy and fostered a sense of national identity among the German people. Luther's ideas also had a major impact on philosophy, politics, education, and culture in Germany and beyond. His teachings challenged traditional Catholic dogma, emphasizing faith alone (Sola Fide) as a path to salvation, and promoting individual conscience over ecclesiastical authority. These ideas influenced figures such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Immanuel Kant, thus contributing to the development of German intellectual thought.",
