At new moon, the Moon is completely obscured by Earth as it passes between us and the Sun. As the Moon moves around in its orbit, it becomes more illuminated until it reaches first quarter, when it appears to be exactly half-lit. It then continues to grow brighter until it is full, which typically occurs around 14 days after new moon. After reaching full moon, the Moon begins to wane, or decrease in size, as it moves toward last quarter and eventually disappears completely once again at new moon.

However, while both Venus and Earth orbit around the sun, there are some crucial differences between the two planets that result in Venus not having seasons like Mars and Earth do. The main reason for this is the significant difference in the tilt of their axes. While Earth's axis is tilted approximately 23 degrees from the vertical, which causes seasonal variations due to the changing position of the planet in relation to the sun, Venus' axis is almost perpendicular to its orbit around the sun, with a negligible tilt of less than three degrees. This means that both poles of Venus receive nearly equal amounts of sunlight throughout the year, resulting in no significant difference between the amount of solar radiation received by each hemisphere, and thus, no discernible seasonal variation.",

The lunar maria formed around 3 billion years ago during a period called the Nectarian era, which followed the Imbrian era that had shaped most of the Moon's surface. During this time, large volcanic eruptions occurred on the near side of the Moon, spewing vast amounts of lava onto the surface and filling in low-lying areas to create the maria. The basaltic lava flows that formed the maria were among the largest known volcanic events in the Solar System, with some covering over 100,000 square miles (260,000 square kilometers).

They are characterized by their distinct features such as a small, solid nucleus surrounded by a hazy atmosphere called the coma and a long, curved tail called the comet's tail or coma tail. The direction of a comet's tail is not random but rather follows a specific path. This is due to the fact that a comet's tail is made up of ionized gas particles known as plasma, which are expelled from the comet as it approaches the sun. These particles interact with the sun's magnetic field and solar wind, causing them to be pushed away from the sun in a direction opposite to the sun's position. This results in the tail appearing to point away from the sun, known as the antisolar or retrograde direction. So, if you were to observe a comet's tail pointing in a specific direction, it would indicate that the comet is currently moving in the opposite direction, toward the outer regions of our solar system.",

    "context": "A number of factors have contributed to the decline in population in Detroit, Michigan, leading the city to propose a unique solution: shrinking its physical size by bulldozing abandoned neighborhoods and selling vacant land to farmers. This population loss can be attributed to several long-standing economic and social challenges. The city's economy has been struggling for decades, with high unemployment rates and low levels of education hindering job creation and attracting new residents. Additionally, Detroit has faced significant disinvestment in its infrastructure, as well as a spike in violent crime that has deterred some from living there. As a result, many residents have chosen to leave the city in search of better opportunities elsewhere, leading to a population loss of over 60% since its peak in the 1950s.",
    "score": 0.6,
    "justification": "The given answer is explicitly stated in the context with almost no additional information required. The context provides a clear explanation of the long-standing economic and social challenges that have contributed to Detroit's population decline, including high unemployment rates, low levels of education, disinvestment in infrastructure, and a spike in violent crime.

    "question": "Which of the following is NOT usually a possible reason for migration?",
    "model_answer": "Finding shelter",
    "context": "Among animals, one potential explanation for migration is seasonal reproduction requirements. While many species do migrate in search of mating and breeding opportunities, some animals may remain in their original habitats year-round to reproduce. Therefore, reproductive needs alone are not always a sufficient reason for migration. Other common causes of migration include finding food sources, avoiding harsh weather conditions, and escaping predators or competition for resources.",
    "score": 0.0,
    "justification": "The context does not explicitly state anything about \"finding shelter\" as a potential explanation for migration. While the text mentions various reasons for migration, such as finding food sources, avoiding harsh weather conditions, and escaping predators or competition for resources, it does not mention shelter as one of them."

    "model_answer": "Gentrification.",
    "context": "This process is commonly referred to as gentrification, a term that describes the transformation of previously neglected or low-income areas into more desirable and economically vibrant communities. Gentrification involves the revitalization of existing buildings and infrastructure through investments in housing, retail spaces, public amenities, and services. It often results in rising property values, increased property taxes, and higher living costs, which can displace long-time residents who may not be able to afford the new housing prices or rents. While gentrification can bring about positive changes such as improved safety, better schools, and increased economic opportunities, it also raises questions about social justice and equity in urban development.",
    "score": 0.6,
    "justification": "The answer \"Gentrification\" is explicitly stated in the given context, which defines gentrification as a process of transforming neglected or low-income areas into more desirable communities. The provided context does not contain any ambiguity, and the term \"gentrification\" is clearly defined, making it possible to infer that the correct answer is indeed \"Gentrification\"."

    "context": "The indigenous peoples of a vast region spanning from the Hudson Bay in Canada to Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of South America speak languages that belong to the largest and oldest language family in the Americas. Known as the Amerind or Native North American linguistic stock, this family encompasses over 1,000 languages, making it the most widely distributed language family in the Western Hemisphere. Some of the most notable branches within this linguistic superfamily include Na-Dené, Caddian, Athabaskan-Eskimo, and Quechua-Aymara, among many others.

While it correctly identifies the language family as the Amerind or Native North American linguistic stock, it also makes some claims that are not explicitly stated in the context. Specifically, the answer states that this language family is \"the oldest, biggest, and most widely distributed\" in the region, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the context. The context only mentions that it is the largest and oldest language family in the Americas, but does not provide specific information about its distribution or size relative to other language families."

    "context": "Walter Christaller was a German geographer and economist who made significant contributions to the field of regional science in the mid-20th century. Central place theory, which he developed, is a concept used to explain the distribution and hierarchy of settlements within a region. The theory suggests that settlements are arranged hierarchically based on their functions or services, with larger, more specialized towns serving as central places for smaller villages and hamlets in the surrounding rural areas. Christaller's work has been influential in understanding regional development patterns and remains relevant today in urban planning and economic geography research.",

    "context": "This perspective, commonly known as cultural determinism or psychological determinism, holds that cultural practices, beliefs, and values originate from within individuals rather than external factors such as social, economic, political, or historical circumstances. This concept suggests that individuals are primarily responsible for shaping their own culture through their unique psychological and cognitive processes, rather than being shaped by external influences. It implies that cultures are not fixed or static entities but rather dynamic and continuously evolving systems created by the collective actions and beliefs of individuals within a society. While this perspective has been challenged by alternative views, such as social determinism, it remains a prominent idea in various fields, including psychology, anthropology, and sociology.",
    "score": 0.44999999999999996,
    "justification": "The answer \"Cultural determinism\" is partially supported by the given context. The passage explicitly describes cultural determinism as \"a perspective\" that suggests individuals shape their own culture through psychological and cognitive processes, rather than external factors. This aligns with the concept of cultural determinism mentioned in the answer. However, the context does not provide a comprehensive definition or detailed explanation of cultural determinism, which leaves some aspects of the concept implicit. Nevertheless, the majority of the idea is explicitly stated, making the score 0.75."

    "model_answer": "Gerrymandering.",
    "context": "Gerrymandering is the practice of manipulating the boundaries of electoral districts in order to gain an unfair political advantage for a particular party or group. This term originated in the late 18th century when Governor Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts signed a redistricting plan that was criticized for creating contorted, salamander-shaped districts. Since then, gerrymandering has become a common tactic employed by political parties to maintain their power and influence in legislative bodies at the local, state, and federal levels. The process typically involves analyzing demographic data, such as race, age, income level, and voter registration, to create district maps that will maximize the number of seats won by the party in power. This can lead to disparities in representation, as districts may be packed with voters from one political persuasion or diluted with voters from another, resulting in an uneven distribution of power. While gerrymandering is a legal practice, it has been criticized for violating principles of fairness and democracy, as well as for potentially suppressing the vote of minority groups and independents.",

    "justification": "The answer \"Gerrymandering\" is explicitly stated in the given context. In fact, the context provides a detailed explanation of what gerrymandering is, its history, and its effects on political representation.
